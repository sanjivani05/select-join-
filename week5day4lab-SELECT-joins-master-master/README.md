# ProGrad Lab | ProGrad Premier League

Like the Indian Premier League (IPL) which happens during April & May every year. Our team organizes ProGrad Premier League at the same time for all the Cricketers in our team. Our PPL schema is a complete repository of limited-over format of Cricket, that includes details like teams competing, player representing each team, scoring details, umpire details etc.

The schema diagram of our database is shown below. Could you help with the below queries?


## What Should You Do
```
Go to Oracle SQL Developer and connect to SYSTEM schema or hr schema.
Start writing your queries in the query builder.
Save the .sql file and upload it in github.
Practice Oracle SQL - DDL Statements.
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

## Instructions

1. ***Do not erase the existing queries.***
2. ***Use the same file to write all your queries.***
3. ***Select the entire query and run it to see the output.***
4. ***Save the file as your_file_name.sql and upload it in github.***
5. ***Refer dml-select-joins.sql file.***

## PROGRESSION 0:
1. You will have two files create-tables.sql and insert-queries.sql.
2. Copy the content of create-tables.sql and execute it in sql developer to create tables in oracle.
3. Copy the code from insert-queries.sql and execute it in sql developer to insert data into tables created.
4. The insert-queries.sql contains two records for every table as a sample.
5. Use it as a reference and add 10 more such records to every table.
